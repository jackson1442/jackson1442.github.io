# Article 13

If you've been lurking around the internet recently, you may have seen a lot of
drama about this "Article 13" in the EU going around. Since most of the other
sites are political action groups that want your money, and many others do a
garbage job of explaining this, I'll try to explain this as briefly and simply
as possible.

## What is it?

This whole deal is Article 13 of *Proposal for a Directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market*.
Essentially, it proposes to the governments of the EU that they should require
sites to host bots that check all work uploaded against a database of
copyrighted materials.

This would be a requirement for all sites accessible within these countries,
like GDPR. Unlike GDPR, this is not in the best interest of users, but rather
large corporations with vast amounts of copyright material.

## Why is this bad?

Almost the entirety of the internet thrives on a law called *Fair Use*. This is
the rule that says you can reuse copyrighted material in parodies, research
sites like Wikipedia (if attributed properly) and adaptations such as memes.

With this law, all of these things that make up internet culture today (think
Pepsi man, Tide pods, etc.) will cease to exist since the copyright bots will
strike.

This already exists at some scale with YouTube, which has a neural network
identify copyrighted works such as TV shows and music. We've seen how that
works out- frequent errors in judgement with long response times from a
company whose business thrives on *having content.* Imagine how much worse the
situation would be if the government ran it, having little-to-no incentive to
work to allow incorrectly flagged content.

## How does this affect me?

Currently, this proposal exists only within the European Union. That's all it
is, and all it ever will be, even if it passes. This is simply a suggestion,
with all the foundations of a law, for the governments residing in the EU.
None are required to follow it, but all are encouraged to. Surely, one
government will eventually adopt it to "protect their content creators," and
through the effect of globalization it will slowly spread.

Like GDPR, all sites that wish to be accessible within the enforcing countries
will need to comply with this requirement, obtaining a license from the private
software company that is making the copyright ID software.

This will affects our 'Muricans in the United States too, since many sites we
use on a daily basis are accessible worldwide. Reddit, YouTube (who already
complies to an extent), other Google services, and really any mainstream
service we have today will need to comply with this law. And, knowing the
current FCC, the US may actually adopt this as law too since it has a positive
effect on business here.

## What can I do to stop this?

If you live in the EU, contact your MEP.
[saveyourinternet.eu](https://saveyourinternet.eu) has a great tool for finding
and contacting your MEP, and has a few prewritten scripts and talking points
for them. Phone calls are generally the most effective method, since you know
they actually answer them.

If you *don't*, but run a website/subreddit/etc. you can help spread awareness.

* **Blogs:** Create a blogpost about this, or link here to tell people what's
going on.
* **Subreddits:** We have a couple options for subreddits.
    * **Add an AutoModerator rule.**
    [This](https://gist.github.com/jackson1442/66eea28004c5be55207884f58efe5fda)
    addition to AutoModerator configuration will remove all posts and leave a
    comment explaining Article 13 and how to take action.
    * **Make a sticky.** [Here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jackson1442/ea11759728015c49db5829e2fe7eb92b/raw/f88a1fde182ac26bd9a66e6cf9208bf35e627c9c/a13%2520sticky.md)
    is a template sticky for your subreddit. Feel free to modify it as you want and
    sticky it at the top of your subreddit.
    * **Change your CSS.** I haven't spoken to any CSS gurus about this, but
    changing the CSS of your subreddit will have a massive impact. If you have
    one on your staff, please have them contact me, /u/jackson1442 and I'll
    link it here.
    * **Stay tuned in the Reddit Mods Discord.** We are planning to organize a
    day of action, where the AutoMod config all comes together at the same
    time. This has proven to have a more profound impact on users of reddit,
    and will result in more people taking action.
* **Other websites:** Talk to your viewers! Find some way to spread the word
about this, because knowledge and awareness are the most important things we
can have to stop this. Every little bit helps.
