Greetings!

I'm jackson1442, and I do lots of things. First and foremost, I'm a student.
I'm also working on teaching myself how to write apps for iOS.

So far, I've created many things that have oddly specific uses, like a python
applet that can control lights on a PiFace using a wii remote. I've also made
[a reddit bot](https://github.com/jackson1442/redditBot) that autocomments on
posts and flairs them according to the score of the comment.

I'm not an extremely verbose person, so that's all I have for now. I'll probably
post here whenever I have some sort of "major update," but that's really it.
